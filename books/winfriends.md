## I. Three Fundamental Techniques in Dealing with People

1. **Don't criticise, condemn or complain.** It puts a person on the defensive and breeds resentment. "Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain - and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving. "A great man shows his greatness," said Carlyle, "by the way he treats little men."
2. **Give honest and sincere appreciation.** It generates enthusiasm, from a desire to feel important. The difference between appreciation and flattery is simple, the former comes from the heart out, the latter from the teeth out. Emerson said: "Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him."
3. **Arouse in the other person an eager want.** Why talk about what you want? The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want. The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it. "If there is any one secret of success," said Henry Ford, "it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."

## II. Six Ways to Make People Like You

1. **Be genuinely interested in other people.** You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.
2. **Smile.** A smile says "I like you. You make me happy." Everybody in the world is seeking happiness, and it doesn't depend on outward conditions, but on inner conditions. "There is nothing either good or bad," said Shakespeare, "but thinking makes it so."
3. **Use a person's name.** The average person is more interested in their own name more than in all the other names on earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid an effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it - and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.
4. **Be a good listener.** "Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention," wrote Jack Woodford.
5. **Talk in terms of the other person's interests.** The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.
6. **Make the other person feel important.** The most important rule in the world is to do unto others as you would have others do unto you. *You* would want approval of those with whom you come in contact. *You* would want recognition of your true worth. *You* would want a feeling that you are important in your own little world. "Talk to people about themselves," said Disraeli, "and they will listen for hours."

## III. Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking

1. **There is only one way to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it.** You can never win an argument, because if you lose it, you lose it, and if you win it, you still lose it. "A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still."
2. **Never say "you're wrong."** You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can in words - and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have struck a direct blow to their intelligence, judgement, pride and self respect.
3. **If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.** "By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected."
4. **Begin in a friendly way.** Kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster and storming in the world.
5. **Get the other person saying "yes" immediately.** This sets the psychological process of the listener moving in the affirmative direction.
6. **Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.** La Rochefoucauld said: "If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you."
7. **Let the other person believe an idea is theirs.** Make a suggestion and let the other person think out the conclusion.
8. **Try to see things from the other person's point of view.** Ask yourself "why would this person want this?"
9. **Be sympathetic with other people's beliefs, ideas and desires.** The magic phrase is "I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would undoubtedly feel just as you do."
10. **Appeal to the nobler motive.** A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one. The person themselves will think of the real one. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good.
11. **Dramatise your ideas.** Merely stating a truth is not enough. If you want attention, the truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic.
12. **Throw down a challenge.** "The way to get things done," said Schwab, "is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel."

## IV. Nine Ways to Change People Without Arousing Resentment
1. **Begin with praise and honest appreciation.** It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points. It is like the dentist who begins their work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is pain-killing.
2. **Call attention to others' mistakes indirectly.** Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word "but" and ending with a critical statement. Change the word to "and" to continue the encouragement.
3. **Talk about your own mistakes first.** It isn't nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticising begins by humbly admitting that they, too, are far from impeccable.
4. **Ask questions instead of giving orders.** Asking questions like "do you think this would work?" or "what do you think of this?" makes an order more palatable and stimulates the creativity of the person whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.
5. **Let the other person save face.** Causing them embarrassment destroys their ego. "I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes," said Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry. "What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself."
6. **Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.** When criticism is minimised and praise emphasised, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.
7. **Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.** If you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.
8. **Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.** Let the other person know that you have faith in their ability to do it, that they have an undeveloped flair for it - and they will practice until the dawn comes in order to excel.
9. **Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.** Know exactly what you want the other person to do. Be empathetic and ask yourself what they really want. Consider the benefits the person will receive from doing what you suggest, then match those benefits to the other person's wants. Finally, when you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that they personally will benefit.
