## 1. Purpose and Why It Matters

- The key to finding fulfillment is to balance both *purpose* and *enjoyment*.
- Purpose without enjoyment is drudgery.
- Enjoyment without purpose is superficiality.
- A life without both is misery.

## 2. Three Purpose Myths

1. **Purpose is something we find.** Purpose is mined and made. Almost any activity can be meaningful if approached properly, considered thoughtfully, and crafted to enhance its purpose.
2. **Purpose is a single thing.** There are many sources of purpose in life. Those who flourish learn to find meaning in almost everything they do.
3. **Purpose is static.** Purpose evolves over time. The multitude of ways in which we gain meaning naturally shifts as we enter new stages of life.

## 3. Mining Your Life for Meaning

1. **Conduct a survey:**
    - What are you good at?
    - Where do you find flow?
    - What moves you emotionally?
    - Where does the world need you?
2. **Assemble a team:**
    - Whose perspective do you respect?
    - Who will act in your best interests?
    - Who complements you?
    - Who challenges you?
    - Who can offer you wisdom you don't yet have?
3. **Drill for meaning:**
    - Who do you serve?
    - What do they need?
    - How can you be a more positive influence on them?
    - Is there more opportunity for craft in what you do?

## 4. Many Sources of Purpose

- Love and relationships
- Avocations, hobbies and self-improvement
- Beautiful experiences
- Occupation and formal education
- Religion, philosophy, or some other guide to the 'good life'
- Service and charity

## 5. Craft Your Work

*Turn the job you have in to the job you want.*

- Identify what gives you meaning by keeping a purpose-enjoyment journal, rating both for every daily task from zero to five. Attempt to emphasise the high scorers in your work.
- Take on new tasks that are meaningful, even if they take time away from core initiatives. A good manager should realise the purpose and energy they bring.
- Do the same job in a different way by writing out all your core tasks, the finding ways to eliminate or streamline the meaningless tasks.

## 6. Make Work A Craft

*Aim for self-improvement and task mastery.*

- Identify opportunities for craft in your work by writing out five activities that require skill, then set goals and share your aspirations with others to keep yourself motivated and accountable.
- Pursue a hobby that allows for craft, setting goals and involving others as above.
- Find competitons - either with yourself or others - which can help you commit to the improvement.
- Appreciate the craft of others. Ask what talent, sacrifice and commitment it requires.

## 7. Connect Your Work to Service

*At work, at home, and in the community.*

- Connect with people using empathy: clients, colleagues, community, capital (shareholders), partners in business, and people you love.

## 8. Invest in Positive Relationships

*Elevate your connections with those in your network."

- Adopt a mindset of care and trust, assuming best intentions and giving the benefit of the doubt.
- Be a mentor and a mentee. For every person you ask as a mentor, become one yourself.
- Continually pursue new relationships (especially with different worldviews) repair broken relationships, but focus the most time on your most positive relationships.
- Make time for relationships outside of work, keeping life and work in balance.
