Although there are thousands of different tactics that compliance practitioners employ to produce yes, the majority fall within six basic categories.

[test](influence.md#2. Consistency)
[test](influence.md#3.|Social|Proof)

# Reciprocation
*"We should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided for us."*

The exchange does not need to be:
- EQUAL: due to the combined force of internal discomfort and possible external shame.
- INVITED: it is not required to have asked for what is received.
- FROM SOMEONE LIKED: there is no relationship between liking and compliance.

The first way to use the rule is the default: In a study, a participant and an assistant - Joe - were asked to rate paintings in an exhibit. In the instances were Joe temporarily left the experiment to buy himself and the participant a soft drink, the participant bought twice as many raffle tickets from Joe at the end of the experiment. The subjects who indicated they disliked Joe bought just as many tickets as those who indicated they liked him. An unfair exchange was also triggered, as the soft drink cost 10c, but the raffle tickets sold for 25c each.

The second way is to employ a reciprocal concession, or reject-then-retreat: A first group of college students were asked to donate a pint of blood every six weeks for three years. A second group was asked for a one time donation. When anyone in the first group refused, the experimentalist conceded to the offer used for the second group. After the donation, when asking if they would donate again, 84% of the first reject-then-retreat group said yes, but only 43% of the second group did.

# 2. Consistency
*"Once we have made a choice, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment."*

A commitment is most powerful when it is:
- ACTIVE: actions (writing it down) speak louder than words.
- PUBLIC: so that we appear like a consistent person, which is a desirable personality trait.
- EFFORTFUL: such as a boot camp, hazing, or initiation ceremony.
- AN INNER CHOICE: without the pressures of external rewards or threats.

When asked to agree to a house visit by a cookie-selling charity, people who were first asked how they were doing and responded positively agreed 32% of the time, as opposed to 18% if not asked. This is because they find it awkward to appear stingy in the context of their own admittedly favoured circumstances. True to the consistency principle, when the visit occured to the houses of those that agreed, 89% made a cookie purchase.

A group of Iowa residents were given energy-saving tips and asked to save natural gas over winter. Those who promised to do so had no better savings than a random sample of their neighbours. Another group was told they would have their names published in the paper if they succeeded. They saved 12.2% by the firsr half of winter. Then, the newspaper offer was rescinded. They saved 15.5% through the second half of winter - even more - as the previous reason had come from the outside, but the new reason was an inner choice.

# 3. Social Proof
*"We view a behaviour as more correct to the extent we see others performing it."*

Social proof is most powerful:
- IN HIGH VOLUME: due to the principle of safety in numbers.
- WHEN UNCERTAIN: evidenced by the pluralistic ignorance of the bystander effect.
- WITH SIMILARITY: when we observe the behaviour of people like us.

A wallet purposefully dropped in Manhattan containing money, personal information and a letter was returned 33% of the time if the letter appeared to be written in broken English by a foreigner, versus 70% if the letter appeared to be written in standard English by an American.

Bartenders salt their tip jars with a few bills, television producers add laugh tracks, and advertisers love to inform when a product is the "fastest-growing" or "largest-selling".

# 4. Liking
*"We prefer to say yes to the requests of people we know and like."*

Liking is improved by:
- PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS: as we automatically assign these people with other positive traits.
- COMPLIMENTS: even if we know the flatterer stands to gain something.
- FAMILIARITY: to names, backgrounds, interests, and cultures.
- COOPERATION: when working towards a common goal, such as when part of a team.
- ASSOCIATION: an innocent assosciation with good or bad things will influence how people feel about us, for instance the "don't shoot the messenger" saying.

At a summer camp, boys were divided in to two groups and a rivalry was stoked through continued competition. To remove the hostility, the boys were put in scenarios were cooperation was necessary for mutual benefit, for instance fixing a vehicle that went to town to get food, or pooling money together to rent a film.

Before being asked about a home team win or loss, college students took a rigged test in which some passed and some failed. Those who failed showed the greatest need to manipulate their connections with the home team to salvage their prestige. 41% used the word "we" when describing a win, and only 17% when describing a loss. Those who passed the test used "we" equally when describing both win or loss, at 24%.

# 5. Authority
*"We are willing to go to almost any length on the command of authority."*

Authority can be faked by:
- TITLES: particularly those adopted without proof.
- CLOTHING: tailored suits, uniform.
- TRAPPINGS: luxury cars, expensive jewellery.

In the Milgram experiment, a learner, the assistant, was delivered fake electric shocks by the participant, a teacher. Independent of gender and whether the assistant was purported to have a heart condition, two thirds of the time the participant would deliver the highest voltage electric shock. They did not want to defy the wishes of the lab-coated professor who directed the subjects to perform their duties.

Pedestrians told to give a person by a parking machine spare change obliged 42% of the time if the requester was wearing street clothes, but 92% of the time if they were in a security guard uniform. The pedestrians themselves guessed that the compliance rates would be 50% and 63%, under-estimating the power of uniform.

# 6. Scarcity
*"Opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited."*

Scarcity can be combined with:
- CENSORSHIP: we hate to lose freedoms we once had.
- RECENT LOSS: we value things that have only recently become less available (e.g. lockdown protests!)
- RIVALRY: we value something more if we are in competition for it.

Beef company customers were asked for a purchase in one of three ways. Group one had a standard sales presentation, group two was told beef was in short supply first, and group three was told both that beef was in short supply and that the information was not widely known - a scarcity double whammy. Group two bought twice as much beef as group one, and group three bought six times as much.

Indifferent lovers are told about a new admirer by their romantic partner, fence-sitters are encouraged by the thought of a new bidder, and shops hold bargain sales events for large groups of peoppe.
