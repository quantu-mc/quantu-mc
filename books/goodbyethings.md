# Goodbye, Things

There are no set rules for being a minimalist. Minimalism isn't necessarily owning less than 100 items, or being able to pack all of your possessions in to a single car or suitcase.

"A minimalist is a person who knows what is truly essential for themselves, who reduces the number of possessions that they have for the sake of things that are really important to them."

## 1. Reasons for Minimalism

People become minimalists for different reasons:
- Those who feel an information and material overload, and want to subtract and refine in order to enhance the important things.
- Those who experience lifestyle creep, and realise that the happiness in buying more things is only temporary.
- Those who desire a nomadic lifestyle and find it easier to move when they own less.
- Those who have lost items in natural disasters, changing how they view possessions.
- Those who no longer want to use their possessions as a way to convey their personality.

## 2. Methods for Decluttering

Specific methods for decluttering are:
- Understand that the act of discarding things does not take time. It is the decision to act that takes time.
- Start with things that are clearly junk and reduce multiples to one.
- Get rid of it if you haven't used it in a year, if you have forgotten about it, or if you have it for the sake of appearance.
- Say 'see you later' for a week or month before you say goodbye. If you manage fine without, they aren't necessary. If a need arises, you don't have to throw them away.
- Digitise things, particularly photos of sentimental objects. As long as you have the images you can recall the memories. With digital albums, those memories can be viewed anywhere, anytime. 
- Think about objects in terms of rent. You pay rent for a certain number of square metres of apartment. What percentage of that are the objects taking up, and so how much of the rent are you paying to keep them there?
- Just as trying to prepare for someday in the future is futile, so too is clinging to what used to be in the past. In any case, it is the memories that we can recall without the aid of objects that are truly important.
- Let go of the idea of getting your money's worth, don't get hung up on prices you initially paid, and avoid the sunken cost fallacy.
- If you can't remember what gifts you've given, don't worry about the gifts you've received.
- You might feel guilty when looking at gifts or items you never used and find it a waste to throw them away. But the true waste is the feeling of guilt every time you look at them, today, tomorrow and in the future.

## 3. Happiness Through Minimalism

Happiness lies in the non-tangible things you gain when you the tangible things become less. You gain happiness as a minimalist through:
- Having more time, since you spend less time looking for things, going shopping for things, and doing chores.
- Having more freedom, the ability to move, to have a different lifestyle, and to be liberated from high living costs and greed.
- No longer comparing yourself with others. Once you only own what you need, your focus shifts from others to yourself.
- Better concentration, since your silent to-do list decreases as your mentality shifts to focus only on what is important. Clutter, both physical and mental, is reduced.
- Gratitude in the present moment, letting go of things you might need in the future and things you needed in the past.
- Saving money, on housing, on items, by selling unwanted possessions, and by reducing the desire for frivolous spending.
- Changing how you spend money, using it on experiences and people, rather than items. The joy from recalling an experience usually lasts longer than the joy from buying things.
