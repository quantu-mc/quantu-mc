# Digital Minimalism

New technologies seem to be draining meaning and satisfaction from our lives. Few want to spend so much time online, but these technologies have a way of cultivating behavioural addictions. They also tend to have an overall negative impact on psychological well-being, by generating feelings of inadequacy, mental exhaustion, and, more insidiously, emotionally charged extremes.

Modest hacks and tips are not sufficient to curb technology's addictive design and cultural strength. What is required instead is a full-fledged philosophy of technology use, such as digital minimalism.

## 1. A Lopsided Arms Race

One of the major selling points of the original iPhone was that it integrated the iPod with a cell phone, preventing someone from having to carry around two separate devices. The way the iPhone has changed how we live since was rapid, unexpected, and unplanned.

"We added new technologies to the periphery of our experience for minor reasons, then woke one morning to discover that they had colonised the core of our daily life."

How is it that these technologies have grown to dictate how we behave and how we feel, coercing us to use them more than is healthy, often at the expense of other activities we find more valuable?

"People don't succumb to screens because they're lazy, but instead because billions of dollars have been invested to make this outcome inevitable."

There are two main forces behind this:

- Intermittent positive reinforcement; in which rewards (e.g. likes or interesting content) delivered unpredictably are more enticing than those delivered with a known pattern. 

- The drive for social approval; or the craving for validation from the 'tribe' and the fear of being rejected or missing out.

## 2. Digital Minimalism

Small changes are not enough to 
solve our big issues with new technologies. We require a new philosophy altogether.

"Digital minimalism is a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimised activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else."

"Digital minimalists don't mind missing out on small things; what worries them much more is diminishing the large things they already know for sure make life good."

Digital minimalism relies on three principles:

1. Clutter is costly. In the words of Thoreau, "the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it." How much of your time and attention must be spent to earn the small profit of occasional connection or new ideas earned through social media?

2. Optimisation is important. Finding the most effective and efficient way to use a technology returns significantly better benefits than just choosing to use it in the first place.
    
3. Intentionality is satisfying. This is derived from mindful and meaningful use of new technologies. The Amish, famous for their reluctance to adopt new technologies, in some cases actually do. They start with the things they value most, then work backward to ask if that new technology performs more good than harm with respect to those values.

## 3. The Digital Declutter

The digital declutter is not a gradual change, it is a rapid transformation in a short period of time, executed with enough conviction that the results are likely to stick.

The process is as follows:

- Put aside a thirty day period during which you will take a break from optional technologies. Consider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm the daily operation of your personal or professional life. You can either abstain from the technology altogether, or specify a set of operating procedures that dictate exactly how and when you use it.

- During this break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviours that you find satisfying and meaningful, which will also act to relieve anxiety and boredom.
  
- At the end of the break, reintroduce optional technologies in to your life. For each one that is reintroduced, determine what value it serves, as well as the operating procedures to best maximise that value.

## 4. Spend Time Alone

‚ÄúAll of humanity‚Äôs problems stem from man‚Äôs inability to sit quietly in a room alone,‚Äù wrote Blaise Pascal.

Everyone benefits from regular doses of solitude. Solitude is about what what‚Äôs happening in your brain, not the environment around you. You can enjoy solitude in a crowded coffee shop or on a subway car, so long as your mind is left to grapple only with its own thoughts. Solitude is required to have the ability to process and make sense of emotions, to reflect on who one is and what really matters, to build strong relationships, or even to just allow the brain time to power down its critical social circuits, which are not meant to be used constantly.

The cognitive oppression that results in the absence of solitude is increasingly self-inflicted by the distraction of the digital screen. This results in solitude deprivation, a state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds. The use of social media and smartphones, causing solitude deprivation, look culpable for the increase in teen mental-health issues. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with connectivity, but if you don‚Äôt balance it with regular doses of solitude, its benefits will diminish.

To practice solitude:

- Leave your phone at home. The urgency we feel to always have a phone with us is exaggerated. A useful compromise is to bring your phone where you're going, but leave it in your car's glove compartment or with a friend, allowing for emergency use.

- Take long walks. Nietzsche, Thoreau, and many others embraced walking as a high-quality source of solitude. This may require scheduling workday walks, negotiating with your family, and learning to broaden your definition of good weather.
  
- Write letters to yourself. Writing a letter to yourself is an excellent mechanism for generating solitude, but also provides a conceptual scaffolding on which to sort and organize your thinking. This can be a special notebook or scraps of paper, and do not need to be added to on a regular schedule, but only when the need arises.

## 5. Don't Click "Like"

Our brains evolved to crave rich social interaction, and serious issues are caused when we displace this interaction with highly appealing, but much less substantial, electronic pings. The more time you spend "connecting" on social media services, the more isolated you're likely to become, since you devote less time to offline communication.

"Face-to-face conversation unfolds slowly. It teaches patience. We attend to tone and nuance. When we communicate on our digital devices, we learn different habits."

A philosophy for socialising in the digital age is conversation-centric communication, in which conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship. Anything textual or non-interactive doesn‚Äôt count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection.

To reclaim conversation:

- Don't click like. It teaches your mind that connection is a reasonable alternative to conversation. Instead, foster instances of real-life conversation.
 
- Consolidate texting. As a compromise between your obligation to be "on call" and your human craving for real conversation, set your phone to do not disturb by default and check texts only on a regular schedule. You can allow calls and texts from emergency contacts if required.
   
- Hold conversation office hours. Put aside set times on set days during which you're available for conversation, either via phone or in person. When someone instigates a low-quality connected, promote to them your high-quality conversation time instead.

## 6. Reclaim Leisure

"A life well lived requires activities that serve no other purpose than the satisfaction that the activity itself generates."

The most successful digital minimalists cultivate high-quality leisure time before culling low-quality digital distractions, filling in the void those distractions helped you to ignore.

The most rewarding leisure activities:

- Prioritise demanding activity over passive consumption: mental faculties are capable of continuous hard activity. Expending more energy in your leisure can end up energizing you more.
 
- Use skills to product valuable things in the physical world: Boasting (the need to offer chattering interpretations of himself to vindicate his worth) is what a boy does, who has no real effect in the world. But craftsmanship must reckon with the infallible judgment of reality, where one‚Äôs failures or shortcomings cannot be interpreted away.
 
- Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions: board games and social fitness are leisure activities that enable the types of energized and complex sociality that are otherwise rare in normal life, and uncommon in polite society. In both cases, it is required to spend time with other people and there is a set of rules for the interaction.

Digital tools can still be used to help cultivate this leisure, whether by watching YouTube videos or searching for local groups.

To upgrade your leisure life:

- Fix or build something every week. Learning and applying new skills to something physical is a satisfying activity. Learn to change your car oil, start a garden plot, or learn an instrument.
  
- Schedule your low-quality leisure. This sets aside time for high-quality activities but doesn't ask you to completely remove the low-quality distractions. This may start as large portions of evenings and weekends, but will decrease as you integrate more high-quality pursuits in to your life.
 
- Follow leisure plans. Finding opportunities for leisure are rarer when you‚Äôre not planning ahead. Strategise your free time with quarterly plans that outline objectives and the required habits, and weekly plans that detail how you will execute those habits that particular week.

## 7. Join the Attention Resistance

Facebook, Google, and other services utilise the attention economy; the business sector that makes money gathering consumers' attention, then repackaging and selling it to advertisers. The best way to use these services is in a manner that optimises the value you receive. This isn't just a common sense adjustment to your digital habits, but a bold act of resistance.

To use these services intentionally:

- Delete social media from your phone. Allowing yourself access via web browser or computer, you preserve your ability to use specific features that you identify as important - but on your own terms.
  
- Turn your devices into single-purpose computers. The power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously. Block social media by default and make it available only on an intentional schedule.

-  Use social media like a professional. Don't see it as a source of entertainment, follow only a small number of accounts, use Facebook only for close friends, and maintain separate Twitter accounts for separate interests.
  
- Embrace slow media. In an age in which the digital attention economy is shovelling more and more clickbait toward us and fragmenting our focus into emotionally charged shards, the right response is to become more mindful in our media consumption. Rather than consuming news through a sequence of websites, focus only on high-quality sources. Read opposing sides of an argument and isolate news consumption to set times during the week.
 
- Dumb down your smartphone. Smartphones are the Trojan horse of the attention economy and without them, efforts to reclaim your attention are significantly simplified. Predominantly using a dumb phone, but still keeping your smartphone, allows you to use the latter for specific purposes, such as travel or exercise.
