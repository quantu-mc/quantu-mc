## 💪 Strengths
1. 🤓 **Curiosity (Wisdom):** "I am interested in exploring new ideas, facts, activities and experiences (including those of other people.) I also have a strong desire to expand my own personal knowledge base and skillset, aiming for mastery. Curiosity is my greatest strength, as it is often my motivation to *persevere* and drives my desire to be open-minded, allowing me to relate to people through *honesty* using *humour*.
2. 😓 **Perseverance (Courage):** "I am hardworking and persist towards my goals despite obstacles or discouragements. Sometimes, I must dig deep and muster the will to overcome thoughts of giving up. But, I am rewarded by the pleasure, success, and confidence I receive from completing tasks and accomplishing goals."
3. 😇 **Honesty (Courage):** “I try to present my feelings and my actions in a genuine and sincere way to each person. I take full responsibility for those feelings and actions, and I am loyal to those few with whom I have deep relationships. I act consistently across all domains in my life and as a result, I am true to myself. This means that my goals accurately represent my implicit interests and values.”
4. 😆 **Humour (Transcendence):** "I recognise what is amusing, look on the lighter side, and like to make people laugh, even in difficult and stressful times. This is the least essential of my character strengths, but it reminds me that not everything enjoyable in life needs to serve a greater purpose."  
5. 😚 **Gratitude (Transcendence):** "There is goodness in my life: financial stability, mental and physical health, comfort at home, few but deep relationships, the ability to be independent, and the kindness and love of others. I want to improve at feeling and expressing a deep sense of thankfulness in life and taking the time to thank others."
