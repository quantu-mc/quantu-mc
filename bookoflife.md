# Character Strengths

## 📚 Curiosity
"I am interested in exploring new ideas, facts, activities and experiences (including those of other people.) I also have a strong desire to expand my own personal knowledge base and skillset, aiming for mastery. Curiosity is my greatest strength, as it is often my motivation to *persevere* and drives my desire to be open-minded, allowing me to relate to people with *honesty* using *humour*."

## 🏆 Perseverance
"I am hardworking and persist towards my goals despite obstacles or discouragements. Sometimes, I must dig deep and muster the will to overcome thoughts of giving up. But, I am rewarded by the pleasure, success, and confidence I receive from completing tasks and accomplishing goals."

## 🗣️ Honesty
"I try to present my feelings and my actions in a genuine and sincere way to each person. I take full responsibility for those feelings and actions, and I am loyal to those few with whom I have deep relationships. I act consistently across all domains in my life and as a result, I am true to myself. This means that my goals accurately represent my implicit interests and values.”

## 🃏 Humour
"I recognise what is amusing, look on the lighter side, and like to make people laugh, even in difficult and stressful times. This is the least essential of my character strengths, but it reminds me that not everything enjoyable in life needs to serve a greater purpose."

# Personality Type

## Advocate (INFJ)

The advocate has introverted, intuitive, feeling and judging personality traits and is the rarest personality type at 2%.

*"Treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being."* - Goethe

**Strengths:**
- **Insightful:** "My intuition gives me the ability to see through the superficial and understand people’s true motivations, feelings, and needs."
- **Passionate:** "I crave a sense of purpose in life. My job isn’t satisfying if it doesn’t offer a deeper sense of meaning, aligned with my values and goals – no matter how good the salary is."
- **Altruistic:** "I want to use my strengths for the greater good, and I rarely lose sight of how my words and actions might affect others. I prefer to use them to build trust and confidence, which allows me to inspire and persuade people towards a common goal."

**Weaknesses:**
- **Sensitive:** "I am not averse to feedback, but I get defensive if someone is challenging my most cherished values and beliefs."
- **Reserved:** "I value honesty and authenticity, but am a private person. As a result, I avoid shallow and superficial friendships. Instead, I crave authentic, meaningful relationships." 
- **Perfectionistic:** "I expect myself and my direct reports to be accurate, motivated and honest. I prefer not to micromanage them, but to empower them to think and act independently in order to create an atmosphere of mutual respect."

## Stable (SC)

Always reflective, but halfway between task-focused (accuracy) and people-focused (support).
