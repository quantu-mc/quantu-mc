D - "All clear."  
R - Clap around head, use words, squeeze shoulders.  
S - "Call 000, get a First Aid kit, get a defibrillator, and come back."  
A - Pistol fingers to tilt head and check airway.  
B - If breathing, put in recovery position. If not breathing, begin CPR. Tilt back an adult's head, do not tilt an infant's head.  
C - 30 compressions, 2 breaths. For a child, use one hand. For a baby, use two fingers. Adjust breath based on the patient's size.  
D - Use within three minutes if possible. Do not touch the patient 1. when it is analysing 2. when the shock is delivered.

## Drowning
Recovery position, then DRSABCD. Always call 000 due to the possiblity of secondary drowning.

## Choking
Five back blows between the shoulder blades, ricocheting upwards. Then five chest compressions, exactly as CPR. Repeat as needed.

## Anaphylaxis
Call 000. Remove the allergen. Lie or sit them down, as they are experiencing shock. Ask questions about their allergies. Assist with or administer Epipen. Check the expiry date and that the window is clear. Always give EpiPen before an asthma puffer. Try and get the upper quadrant of the opposite thigh, so the patient does not move away. Leave the EpiPen by their head and record time of administration.

## Asthma
One puff, four breaths in and out, four times. Wait four minutes, then repeat. Wait another four minutes, then call 000. If they do not have a blue puffer of their own, it is okay to borrow someone else's.
