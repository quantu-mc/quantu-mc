- 👋 Hi, I’m @quantu-mc. I'm a quantum physicist turned beer brewer.
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of brewing, science, mathematics, and computer programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github to create a brewer's reference knowledge base.
- 🍺 In the future I would also like to learn Python for data analysis of production trends.
